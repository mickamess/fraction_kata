Write a program that implements the addition of fractions. A Fraction is a value object, once created it cannot be mutated. 
The `add method must return a new Fraction instance. 

Fractions must be reduced.



An implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) is provided:



static int gcd(int a, int b){
  
  return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); 

}
